# dot py

dot py is a Friday-weekly Python users group which meets at [801Labs](http://www.801labs.org/).

In learning Python, each user at meetings will work with an IRC chatbot, [sopel](https://sopel.chat/). Sopel will be running on a setup that includes Oracle VirtualBox, HashiCorp Vagrant, and Ubuntu GNU/Linux. Ideally, the VM setup will be fairly effortless for the user.
